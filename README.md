## User-Driven-Route-Finder-and-Optimizer
A C++ console program that helps users find and optimize travel routes between locations, considering distance, traffic, construction, and travel mode. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), user input handling, and basic pathfinding in C++.

## Features

- **Predefined Locations and Routes:** Includes locations like Home, School, Mall, Park, Hospital, and Office, each connected by routes with specific attributes.
- **User Input:** Select start and end locations, and choose your travel mode (walk, bike, car).
- **Pathfinding:** Finds all possible routes between your selected locations using depth-first search (DFS).
- **Route Details:** For each route, displays segment-by-segment breakdown, including distance, U-turns, traffic conditions, and construction status.
- **Time Estimation:** Calculates estimated travel time for each route and travel mode, adjusting for traffic and U-turns.
- **Top Route Options:** Shows the two fastest route options with detailed breakdowns and travel time estimates for all modes.
- **Best Route Recommendation:** Recommends the best route, prioritizing those without construction if their time is within 10% of the fastest route.
- **User-Friendly Prompts:** Validates all user inputs and guides the user through each step with clear messages.

## How the Code Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   The program creates a set of locations and routes. Each route has a start and end location, distance, number of U-turns, traffic level, and construction status.

2. **User Interaction:**  
   The user is shown a list of locations and asked to select a start and end point by number. The user then selects a travel mode.

3. **Pathfinding:**  
   The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible paths between the selected locations, avoiding cycles and limiting the path length for practicality.

4. **Route Analysis:**  
   For each route, the program calculates total distance, U-turns, construction presence, and estimates travel time for the chosen mode (with adjustments for traffic and U-turns).

5. **Results Display:**  
   The two fastest routes are displayed with all details. The best route is recommended, favoring those without construction if their travel time is close to the fastest.

6. **Repeat or Exit:**  
   The user can search for more routes or exit the program. All inputs are validated for correctness.

## Code Structure

| Class              | Purpose                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Location`         | Stores the name of each location                                                        |
| `Route`            | Represents a route segment with start/end, distance, U-turns, traffic, construction     |
| `RouteManager`     | Manages locations, routes, and all pathfinding and display logic                        |
| `UserInputHandler` | Handles all user prompts, input validation, and main interaction loop                   |

**Key Algorithms and Functions:**

- **DFS Pathfinding:**  
  Finds all possible paths from start to destination, avoiding cycles and limiting depth.

- **Travel Time Calculation:**  
  Calculates estimated time for each route segment and entire path, with speed and traffic adjustments.

- **Route Display:**  
  Shows each segmentâ€™s details and summarizes total distance, U-turns, construction, and travel times.

- **Best Route Recommendation:**  
  Compares all routes and recommends the best one based on construction status and travel time.
